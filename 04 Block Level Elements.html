      India seamer Harshal Patel is not worried that batters have started
      anticipating his variations. In the first T20I, Rassie van der Dussen had
      smashed Harshal for three sixes and a four in an over to turn the game
      around. After the match, van der Dussen had said that post the first two
      sixes, he knew Harshal would turn to his slower balls.

      "People have been trying to anticipate for the past two years," Harshal
      said on the eve of the fourth T20I against South Africa. "To be very
      honest, with every bowler, the longer they play, the more the opposition
      will realise what their strengths are, what the patterns are, and try to
      adapt to it. But as a bowler, my job is to stay one step ahead of batters.
